= therapist

A command line tool for dealing with your (GitHub) issues.

Install it:

    $ sudo gem install technicalpickles-therapist


It works by guessing groking a git repository to figure out the user and repository on GitHub, and then hitting their API to get the issues. The issues get stashed in .git/issues to avoid constantly hitting the API, and for offline convenience.

Here's how you might use it:

    $ cd jeweler
    $ therapist list
    #1     open: Windows Compatibility
    #2     open: remove jeweler tasks' dependence on rake i.e. to allow thor to use the tasks
    #6     open: Project creation failing (adding origin remote)
    #8     open: rubyforge:release failing because no processor_id or release_id configured for
    #9     open: rake rubyforge:setup creates duplicate packages
    #13    open: GitHub Pages - RDoc to Branch
    #16    open: 'rake release' not idempotent after failure
    #18    open: RDoc rake task looks for VERSION.yml but plaintext is now default
    #19    open: Jeweler can not read my ~/.gitconfig
    #20    open: The Umlaut problem: UTF-8 chars get converted to unicode entities
    #21    open: generating new project double quotes author and e-mail in Rakefile
    #22    open: no such file to load -- shoulda (LoadError)
    #23    open: .gitignore files showing up in s.test_files section of gemspec
    
Knowing an issue you want to look in, you can show more details:


    $ therapist show 22
    #22 open: no such file to load -- shoulda (LoadError)
